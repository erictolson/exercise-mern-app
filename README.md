# portfolio-project-three
Portfolio project as a byproduct of my computer science studies at Oregon State University. Representative of course CS 290, Web Development.

This project represents a single page application that tracks user exercises and is written with the MERN stack. The React framework is used for the front-end UI app. Node and Express are used to write a REST API for the back-end web service. MongoDB is used for persistence.
